# Roots Toolchain

This is fun side-project. I want to build *everything* from scratch. Here a few of my goals.

## Goals

- [] C Compiler
	This is the base of the whole project. I want to compile all subsequent projects using this compiler.
- [] Text Editor
	I want to use the text editor to build all the other projects. While I don't have it I'm going to write all the code using vim with no extensions.
- [] Operating System
	Once the text editor and the compiler are mature enough, I want to start work on an OS. I don't want to have a comercial one, but I want to be able to run it in actual hardware.
- [] Shelll
	This one kind of comes hand-in-hand with the OS, but it is its own beast, I want to do a lot of work on this one as well.

## Direction

This is a fun side project I want to start working on, I don't really care about contributions, so if any is made I will take into consideration if I want to keep it or not. Don't expect to use this code, it is going to be mostly shit, I don't care, this one is a challenge for myself, not a comercial project.
