# Roots Toolchain

This is fun side-project. I want to build *everything* from scratch. Here a few of my goals.

## Goals


- [ ] *Version Control System*: Currently, I am going to use git, I want to have my own.
- [ ] *Project management software*: A system that I can use to manage projects, issues and tasks
- [x] *C Lexer*: The lexer is going to be the lexer that is going to be used by the compiler, by the formatter, by the parser, we can use it for linters, etc.
- [ ] *C Parser*: The Parser is going to be the basis of the compiler's frontend.
- [ ] *C Preprocessor*: A preprocessor for the C language, so that we can plug into our C compiler to handle # statements
- [ ] *C Code Formatter*: This is a dev tool, that will make my life significantly easier, since I won't need to format everything from scratch.
- [ ] *C Compiler*: This is the base of the whole project. I want to compile all subsequent projects using this compiler.
- [ ] *Build system*: Since currently I don't have a build system, I am using C itself in order to be able to compile stuff.
- [ ] *Text Editor*: I want to use the text editor to build all the other projects. While I don't have it I'm going to write all the code using vim with no extensions.
- [ ] *Operating System*: Once the text editor and the compiler are mature enough, I want to start work on an OS. I don't want to have a comercial one, but I want to be able to run it in actual hardware.
- [ ] *Shelll*: This one kind of comes hand-in-hand with the OS, but it is its own beast, I want to do a lot of work on this one as well.

## Direction

This is a fun side project I want to start working on, I don't really care about contributions, so if any is made I will take into consideration if I want to keep it or not. Don't expect to use this code, it is going to be mostly shit, I don't care, this one is a challenge for myself, not a comercial project.
 
## Milestones

- 18, August 2025: I got the lexer being able to lex itself :P. There is still work to be done there, but it is in a nice place
