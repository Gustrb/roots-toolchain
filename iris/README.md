# Iris Lexer

Iris, is the messenger goddess who runjs between Olympos and the mortal world, so just as Iris carries the gods' words, this lexer is going to carry raw characters into meaningful glorious tokens.

## Getting started

To start coding you need to bootstrap the compiler, I am currently using no build system since I haven't coded one yet. To build the build     script you can run the following command (Unix-only).

```sh
$ gcc build.c -Wall -Wextra -pedantic
```

Then you can just run the following command to build everything:

```sh
$ ./a.out
```
