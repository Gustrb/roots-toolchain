A shit C token explorer that I want to use so I can debug the tokenizer and explore C projects. 

## Getting started

To start coding you need to bootstrap the build system, I am currently using no build system since I haven't coded one yet. To build the build script you can run the following command (Unix-only).

```sh
$ gcc build.c -Wall -Wextra -pedantic
```

Then you can just run the following command to build everything:

```sh
$ ./a.out
```
